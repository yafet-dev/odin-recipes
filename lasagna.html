    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but
      my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
      Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
      salad and crusty garlic bread.

    <h2>How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook the meat: </strong>Cook the ground meat in a skillet
          until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until
          it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the
          parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook the noodles: </strong>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
          salted water until they're al dente.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the cheese layer: </strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan
          cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in
          a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong> Assemble the lasagna: </strong>Layer the ingredients
          according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with
          mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>the lasagna: </strong>Cover with foil and bake in the
          preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
          baking until the top is golden brown.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
        serving.
      </li>
